Origin
------
Hynek Schlawack `wrote an article <http://hynek.me/articles/python-app-deployment-with-native-packages/>`_ about python
application deployment using native linux packages. This project is an attempt to formalise some
of those ideas into a more generic installation framework that follows those guidelines.

Build Host
----------

Parcel uses the concept of a *build host* (or hosts) to simplify build procedures. The premise is thus: for each platform you 
want to target for deployment, you have a build host of the same architecture with the same software on it. Fabric connects to 
these machines and issues the build commands. This way the binary package created will be tailored to the final hardware.

These build hosts can be real machines, virtual machines, or cloud instances. It is important that the build hosts mirror
your live deployment environment.

So for example, if your live servers were a mixture of Redhat on 64bit Intel architecture, and Debian on 32bit hardware, then
you would have two build hosts, one Redhat 64bit and one Debian 32bit. You would then build rpms and debs of your project on 
those respective boxes.

The build hosts are specified to fabric via the -H hosts command. For example the following will build two deb packages for
the project for two different platforms::

    $ fab -H debian32.localdomain,debian64.localdomain deb
    
Localhost as Hub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parcel conforms to the idea of being the hub in all connections. Where everything is being pushed to and pulled from the local machine
from which you issue your `fab` commands. So for instance, after a .deb is built, it is pulled back to the localhost.
When the build host needs a new version of code, the code is copied across to the build machine. It is `not` checked out on
the build machine. When completed packages are pushed into repositories, it is done from the local machine, not from the build host.

This has the advantages of keeping all connection authentication local to the developers machine. No private credentials need
to be moved onto a build host to enable it to connect further. Once you have an ssh agent with your keys installed everything
runs seamlessly.

It also helps keep the software that needs to be installed on the build host to a minimum. For example, mercurial or git does
not need to be installed on the build host.

Build From Source, Deploy As Binary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parcel performs builds on the build host from source rather than binaries. Then that source is honed down into a
package that is distributed as a binary. Rather that builds being performed using eggs, or packages, all the source is checked 
out and a full source build is done. This ensures complete compatability with the deployment architecture and system arangement. 
Once this full source build is done, the resultant compiled files are packaged.
