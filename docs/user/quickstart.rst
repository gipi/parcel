Quickstart
==========

.. module:: parcel.models

This page gives a good introduction in how to get started with Parcel. 
This assumes you already have Requests installed. If you do not,
head over to the :ref:`Installation <install>` section.

First, make sure that:

* Parcel is :ref:`installed <install>`
* Parcel is :ref:`up-to-date <updates>`

Secondly, make sure you have a build host setup that you can use to build some packages.
You could setup a :ref:`Debian machine to be a build host <buildhost>` for this quickstart.

From here we assume that you build host is a debian machine available with the name
`debian.localdomain`. Replace that name where it occurs below with your debian machines hostname
or ip address. Let's get started with some simple examples.

Making a Package
------------------

Making a package is very simple. Begin by going to the base directory of your project and making a file `fabfile.py`.

Then in that file write the following::

    from parcel.deploy import Deployment

    def deb():
        deploy = Deployment("myapp")
        deploy.prepare_app()
        deploy.build_deb()
        
Now save the fabfile and at the commandline issue::

    $ fab -H debian.localdomain deb
